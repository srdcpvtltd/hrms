Certain of the following services may require you to provide additional personal information as detailed below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.

The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.VOTING</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues, Services, and/or the Website. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. We may use a system to &quot;tag&quot; users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.SURVEYS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may conduct user surveys from time to time to better target our content to our Website users.

HRM may use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. No security measures, however, are 100% complete. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will not be collected and used by others. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. HRM is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your information or for any lost, stolen, compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized password activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22pt\"><strong>E.

For instance, when you contract for a specific Service with another Registered User, HRM will send that Registered User a notice that includes the personal information that you have chosen to allow HRM to reveal to users with whom you contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22pt\"><strong>F. EXTERNAL WEBSITES LINKS</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Website may contain links to other websites or resources over which HRM does not have any control. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by HRM of those external websites. You acknowledge that HRM is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that HRM is not responsible for the content of such external websites. We are not responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such external websites and such sites are not governed by this Policy. Your use of any external website is subject to the terms of use and privacy policy located on the linked to external website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22pt\"><strong>G. EDIT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can review, correct and delete your personal information by logging into the Website and navigating to your preferences page in &quot;Edit Profile.&quot; You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Typically, we will not manually alter your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. Nonetheless, upon your request we will close your Account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible based on your Account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain information from closed Accounts in order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any Registered User, enforce our Terms of Use, and take any other actions otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our sole and absolute discretion. You should understand, however, that once you publicly post a Request, Offer, Want, Feedback, or any other information onto the Website, you may not be able to change or remove it. Once we have deleted or removed your Account, you agree that HRM shall not be responsible for any personal information that was not included within your deleted and/or removed Account that remains on the Website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22pt\"><strong>H. CHOICES YOU HAVE DURING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your Account or any Services you have requested or received from us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22pt\"><strong>I. AD NETWORKS BY THIRD PARTIES</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We participate in third party ad networks that may display advertisements on other websites based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party&#39;s specific privacy policy, and not by HRM &#39;s Policy. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22pt\"><strong>J. YOUR FULL NAME AND USE OF HRM INFORMATION </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. FULL NAME OF YOURS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Registered User of the Website you will select a Full Name during the registration process. All of your activities on the Website will be traceable to your Full Name. Certain other people, including other Registered Users with whom you have transacted business via the Website, can see a large part of your activity on the Website. If you book a service with a Registered User, cancel a scheduled service with a Registered User, receive an offer on your posted service from a Registered User, or have posted a service, HRM may send a notice to you or the appropriate Registered User that includes your Full Name. Thus, if you associate your real name with your Full Name, the people to whom you have revealed your name may be able to personally identify your Website activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.USING INFORMATION FROM HRM </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Website facilitates your sharing of personal information with others in order to negotiate, provide, and use the Services. If you agree to contract for a service with another Registered User, you may need to reveal your name, email, phone number, or personal address to that individual so that the service may be performed. Please respect the privacy of others. You agree to use the information of other users solely for the following purposes: (a) HRM -transaction-related purposes; and (b) using Services offered through the Website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. PROTECT YOUR ACCOUNT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your password is the key to your Account. When creating your password, you should use unique numbers, letters, special characters, and combinations thereof. In addition, DO NOT disclose your password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, you are solely responsible for all actions taken via your Account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Thus, IF YOUR PASSWORD HAS BEEN COMPROMISED FOR ANY REASON, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY HRM TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22pt\"><strong>K.

Payment obligations are non-cancelable, regardless of utilization by the Customer and except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, Fees paid are non-refundable. Customer will pay the Fees through an accepted payment method as specified in the applicable SOF or Website. Unless otherwise set forth in the SOF, Customer&rsquo;s subscription to the Services will renew automatically for a Subscription Term in accordance with the renewal terms and conditions set forth in Section 6(b) below. During the Term, the Customer may not reduce their Service Plan or User count.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Late</strong> <strong>Payments</strong>-&nbsp;If undisputed Fees are more than thirty (30) days overdue, then, following written notification from 24hourworx, 24hourworx may suspend Customer&rsquo;s access to the 24hourworx Technology, including, without limitation, Customer&rsquo;s Account, until such unpaid Fees are paid in full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Payment</strong> <strong>Disputes</strong>-&nbsp;24hourworx will not exercise its rights under Section 5(b) (Late Payments), 6(d) (Termination for Cause) or Section 6(c)(i) (Suspension of Service) with respect to non-payment by Customer if Customer is disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve such a dispute within thirty (30) days, each party will have the right to seek any remedies it may have under this Agreement, at law or in equity, irrespective of any terms that would limit remedies on account of a dispute. For clarity, any undisputed amounts must be paid in full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Orders</strong> <strong>by</strong> <strong>Affiliates</strong>-&nbsp;Customer&rsquo;s Affiliates may purchase Services directly from 24hourworx by executing an SOF which is governed by the terms of this Agreement. Such SOF will establish a new and separate agreement between the Customer&rsquo;s Affiliate and the 24hourworx entity signing such SOF. If the Affiliate resides in a different country than Customer, then the SOF may include modifications to terms applicable to the transaction(s) (including but not limited to tax terms and governing law).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><strong>Term, Termination and Suspension</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Term</strong>-&nbsp;This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date (or, for online Customers, the date of sign up on the Website) and will continue through the then-current Subscription Term. Service Plans commence on the start date specified in the relevant SOF (or, for online Customers, the date of sign up on the Website) and continue for the Subscription Term specified therein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Renewal</strong>-&nbsp; Unless a party gives written notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the relevant Subscription Term, Service Plans will automatically renew for a period equal to the previous Subscription Term or one year (whichever is shorter). 24hourworx reserves the right to increase the Fees at the beginning of each Subscription Term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suspension</strong>-&nbsp;24hourworx may suspend Customer&rsquo;s access to the Services, Software, Mobile Apps and/or Customer&rsquo;s Account, on the following grounds: (i) late payment/non-payment of undisputed Fees, per the process noted above; (ii) non-renewal of the Services by Customer; (iii) Customer&rsquo;s or its Users&rsquo; breach of Section 2 (Use Restrictions); or (iv) in the event suspension is deemed necessary by 24hourworx to prevent or address the introduction of Malicious Software (as defined in Section&nbsp; 8.b below), a security incident, or other harm to Customer, 24hourworx, or 24hourworx&#39; other customers.&nbsp; 24hourworx will notify Customer of any such suspension. 24hourworx will use diligent efforts to attempt to limit, where commercially feasible, the suspension to affected Users or 24hourworx Technology, and will immediately restore the availability of the same as soon as the issues leading to the suspension are resolved.&nbsp; Such suspension will in no way affect Customer&rsquo;s other obligations under this Agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Termination</strong> <strong>for</strong> <strong>Cause</strong>-&nbsp;Either party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the event that (i) such other party materially breaches this Agreement and does not cure such breach within thirty (30) days of such notice, or (ii) immediately in the event the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Free</strong> <strong>Trial</strong> <strong>Customers</strong>-&nbsp;Upon the expiration of Customer&rsquo;s free trial, 24hourworx may immediately suspend Customer&rsquo;s access to the Services.

Customer agrees, following the termination or expiration of this Agreement or an unrenewed Subscription Term, that Customer Data will be retained or deleted in accordance with the Supplemental Terms, as applicable to Customer. Where Customer Data is retained by 24hourworx and can be exported, and provided that Customer is current on its payment obligations as described in Section 5, Customer may contact 24hourworx within fourteen (14) days following the effective date of termination to have 24hourworx export Customer&rsquo;s Customer Data. Customer Data cannot be recovered once it is deleted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>-&nbsp;Each party will protect the other&rsquo;s Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as it protects its own Confidential Information of similar nature or importance, and in any event, using no less than reasonable care. Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, the receiving party may use the disclosing party&rsquo;s Confidential Information solely to exercise its respective rights and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement, and will disclose such Confidential Information solely to those of its respective employees, representatives and agents who have a need to know such Confidential Information for such purposes and who are bound by obligations to maintain the confidentiality of, and not misuse, such Confidential Information.&nbsp; The provisions of this section will supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between the parties entered into prior to this Agreement that would purport to address the confidentiality of any information shared by the parties, including Customer Data, and such agreement will have no further force or effect with respect to the foregoing.&nbsp; If the receiving party is required by law or court order to disclose Confidential Information of the disclosing party, then the receiving party will, to the extent legally permitted, provide the disclosing party with advance written notification and cooperate in any effort to obtain confidential treatment of the Confidential Information.&nbsp; The receiving party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the receiving party, the disclosing party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><strong>Warranties/Disclaimer of Warranties</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Service</strong> <strong>Warranty</strong>-&nbsp;24hourworx warrants that the Services, Software or Mobile Apps will perform in all material respects in accordance with the Documentation. Provided that Customer provides written notice of a claim within thirty (30) days after first becoming aware of a breach of the foregoing warranty, 24hourworx will use diligent efforts to correct the Services, Software, or &nbsp;Mobile Apps so the foregoing warranty is met, and if 24hourworx is unable to make such corrections in a timely manner, either party may terminate the applicable SOF, and Customer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, will be entitled to receive a refund of any unused Fees that Customer has pre-paid for the applicable Services, Software or Mobile Apps purchased thereunder. This warranty will not apply if the error or non-conformance was caused by Customer&rsquo;s breach of this Agreement or Customer&rsquo;s or its Users&rsquo; misuse of the Services, Software, and Mobile Apps, modifications to the Services, Software, and Mobile Apps by anyone other than 24hourworx or its representatives, or third-party hardware, software, or services used in connection with the Services, Software, and Mobile Apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Malware</strong> <strong>Warranty</strong>-&nbsp;24hourworx warrants that the Services hosted by 24hourworx will be monitored using commercially available means to attempt to detect and prevent the introduction of any computer instructions, circuitry or other technology means whose purpose or effect is to disrupt, damage or interfere with the authorized use of, or allow access to, the computer and communications facilities or equipment of 24hourworx or Customer, including, without limitation, any code containing viruses, Trojan horses, worms, backdoors, trap doors, time-out devices or similar destructive or harmful code or code that self-replicates (collectively, &ldquo;Malicious Software&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Warranty</strong> <strong>Disclaimer</strong>-&nbsp;Except as expressly set forth in this agreement, neither party makes any other warranties, express or implied, statutory or otherwise, and all such warranties are hereby disclaimed, including but not limited to warranties of merchant ability, title, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14pt\"><strong>Indemnification</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Indemnification by Customer</strong>-&nbsp;Customer will defend 24hourworx and its Affiliates from any third party claim (&ldquo;Claim&rdquo;), and will indemnify and hold harmless&nbsp; 24hourworx and its Affiliates from and against any damages and costs awarded against 24hourworx and its Affiliates, or agreed in settlement by Customer (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) resulting from such Claim, to the extent caused by: (i) Customer&rsquo;s or its Affiliate&rsquo;s unauthorized supply, disclosure, or processing of Customer Data, including Personal Data therein, or (ii) Customer&rsquo;s or its Affiliate&rsquo;s violation of laws applicable to Customer&rsquo;s or its Affiliate&rsquo;s business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Indemnification Procedures</strong>-&nbsp;In the event of a potential indemnity obligation, the indemnified party will: (i) promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, (ii) allow the indemnifying party the right to control the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim at the indemnifying party&rsquo;s sole cost and expense, and (iii) upon request of the indemnifying party, provide all necessary cooperation at the indemnifying party&rsquo;s expense. Failure by the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party of a claim under this Section will not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this Section, however, the indemnifying party will not be liable for any litigation expenses that the indemnified party incurred prior to the time when notice is given or for any damages and/or costs resulting from any material prejudice caused by the delay or failure to provide notice to the indemnifying party in accordance with this Section. The indemnifying party may not settle any claim that would bind the indemnified party to any obligation (other than payment covered by the indemnifying party or ceasing to use infringing materials) or require any admission of fault by the indemnified party, without the indemnified party&rsquo;s prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any indemnification obligation under this Section 10 will not apply if the indemnified party settles or makes any admission with respect to a claim without the indemnifying party&rsquo;s prior written consent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14pt\"><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Use</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Third Parties for Payment Processing</strong>-&nbsp;24hourworx may use a third-party service provider to manage payment processing provided that such service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use Customer&rsquo;s payment account information except to process Customer&rsquo;s payment information for 24hourworx.

Any attempted assignment in violation of this section will be null and void.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong>-&nbsp;This Agreement, together with any SOF, the Privacy Notice, and Supplemental Terms, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes any and all prior agreements or communications between Customer and 24hourworx regarding the subject matter hereof. In the event of a conflict between&nbsp;the Privacy Notice, the Supplemental Terms, or any SOF or purchase order and this Agreement, the order of precedence will be, first, the Privacy Notice, second, the SOF, third, the Supplemental Terms, and fourth, this Agreement.&nbsp; If any provision in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Publicity</strong> <strong>Right</strong>-&nbsp;24hourworx may identify Customer as a 24hourworx customer in its promotional materials.&nbsp; Customer may request that 24hourworx stop doing so by submitting an email &nbsp;at any time.

The parties hereby submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of the State of California, San Francisco County for any claims or dispute relating to this Agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dispute</strong> <strong>Resolution</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, will be determined by arbitration in San Francisco, California. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS pursuant to its arbitration rules and procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
